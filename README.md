<h2 align="center"> Hi there! I'm Malu👋</h2>

<p>🤓 Just a brazilian girl trying to learn how to code 🤓</p>

### 🧠 Currently exploring
- 🖥️ HTML
- 🎨 CSS
- 🐧 Linux servers & networking sorcery 
- ✍️ Japanese 日本語 — slowly but surely  

### Fun facts

- I talk to my terminal like it’s my nakama.  
- I have **TOEFL** & **Cambridge** English certifications — but I still Google errors in panic.  
- I'm on a long quest to learn Japanese (wish me がんばって).  
- I once spent 3 hours debugging… a missing semicolon.
